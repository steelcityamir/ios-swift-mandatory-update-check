# iOS SwiftUI Mandatory Update Check
This repository demonstrates how to implement a mandatory update check in a SwiftUI iOS app. It ensures users are prompted to update their app when their version is below the minimum supported.

Features:
âœ… Check the latest app version from a remote source
âœ… Display an alert forcing users to update
âœ… Redirect users to the App Store for the latest update
âœ… Simple and lightweight SwiftUI implementation

Use Case:
- Ensure all users are on supported version(s)
- Enforce critical updates for bug fixes and security patches
- Improve user experience by preventing outdated app usage

ðŸ“Œ Ideal for iOS developers looking to add a force update mechanism to their SwiftUI apps!
